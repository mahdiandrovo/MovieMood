# MovieMood

This is a very simple demo project. I have tried to merge most important elements which are related to Professional Android Application Development.

##### Application Overview:
A user can search any movie.User can get detailed information about movies.

##### Application Frontend:
This is a demo app. That’s why I didn’t put that much importance on it. I know good looking is also very important. Day by day it will improve.

##### Application Backend:
- **Kotlin:** Kotlin is used as the programming language to develop the whole project.
- **MVVM:** Model-View-ViewModel architechture has been followed.
- **Android Jetpack:** Some of Android Jetpack components have been used like Navigation, LiveData, DataBinding etc.
- **Kotlin Coroutines:** Coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that can be used on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. This feature also been used for Network calls.
- **Retrofit:** To maintain HTTP calls in the app Retrofit has been used.
- **Hilt-Dagger:** Hilt-Dagger provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application. This feature is used.
